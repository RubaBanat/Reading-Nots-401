# Data Modeling

 **1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**

 - Better program design and higher code quality
 - Easier to refactor
 - High test coverage

---

 **2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

 when a method should run before a test and another method should run after it. 

---

 **3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development**

 not running tests frequently enough or writing too many tests at once

---

**4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

ES6 Classes are syntactical sugar so it is easier to read and write.

---

**5. Why REST?**

 is an architectural style for establishing web-based specifications for computer systems, making it simpler for them to communicate with one another.

Word | Definition 
------------ | -------------
functional programming |  is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
object-oriented programming (OOP) | Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself
class | templates for creating objects. The constructor() method is used for creating and initializing an object created with a class. Can only be one constructor() per class
`super`| this is used to call the constructor of the super (parent) class
`this` | refers to the current object being instantiated
Test Driven Development (TDD)|is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
Jest |  is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
Continuous Integration (CI) | consistent merging from multiple places into one multiple time a day
REST | Representational State Transfer. Uses HTTP requests to retrieve/use data
Data Model | a model that describes the data and their relations

## Preparation Materials

### SQL vs NoSQL Database

**SQL**

- Relational
- table-based	
- standard schema	
- vertically scalable
- Best for complex query

**NoSQL**

- non-relational or distributed
- document-based, key-value pairs, graph
- dynamic schema
- horizontally scalable
- Best for hierarchical data storage

---

 ### Mongoose

It is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js.
